    "This series aims to provide an in-depth understanding of each building block within the Atomic Agents framework, in this notebook we will dive into Tools and create a simple CalculatorTool. \n",
    "Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to AI agent development, this series will offer valuable insights into how to effectively utilize and extend the Atomic Agents framework for your AI applications.\n",

    "# What is the purpose and functionality of Tools.\n",
    "Tools in multi-agent compound AI systems serve critical functions that enhance specialization, facilitate collaboration, improve efficiency, ensure robustness, and support decision-making. By integrating these tools, multi-agent systems can tackle complex tasks more effectively, making them indispensable in various domains, from enterprise applications to real-world problem-solving scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples are:\n",
    "- Data Retrieval and Processing\n",
    "- Communication and Coordination\n",
    "- Task Automation and Execution\n",
    "- Decision Support and Optimization\n",
    "- Monitoring and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "# BaseTool\n",
    "Let's have a look at what the `BaseTool` provides, then we will create the Calculator tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "- **input_schema** (Type[BaseAgentIO]): The schema for the input data.\n",
    "- **output_schema** (Type[BaseAgentIO]): The schema for the output data.\n",
    "- **tool_name** (str): The name of the tool, derived from the input schema's title.\n",
    "- **tool_description** (str): The description of the tool, derived from the input schema's description or overridden by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public Functions\n",
    "- **run()**:  Runs the chat agent with the given user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an overview of what we have to define to be able to create a tool.\n",
    "To create the `BaseTool` we need to prepare all the parts we need to configure and instantiate the Agent.\n",

It validates input and output data structures using Pydantic, parses and evaluates mathematical expressions using SymPy, and prints the results using Rich. The main execution block demonstrates how to use the tool by creating an instance, running it with an example input, and printing the result."
