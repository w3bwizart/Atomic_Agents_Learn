# Atomic Agents: Learn

This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring the Atomic Agents framework. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide and set of examples to help users understand and utilize the Atomic Agents framework for building AI agents.

## Overview

The Atomic Agents framework is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use. It allows for the creation of powerful AI applications by combining small, single-purpose components. The framework is built on top of the Instructor package and leverages Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
